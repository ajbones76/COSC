Standard ACL should be placed as close to destination as possible
Extended should be placed as close to source as possible

IDS/IPS Recognition Methods:
Signature-looking for known signature
Heuristic/Behavioral-looking at baseline and looking for behaviors outside of baseline

SNORT HEADER:
<action> <protocol> <s.ip> <s.port> <direction> <d.ip> <d.port> ( match conditions ;)
Actions:
alert, log, pass, drop, reject, sdrop
protocol:
TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP (TCP, UDP, and ICMP combined)
Direction:
incoming (â†’), either direction (<>)
SNORT Rule Options:
msg, reference, sid, rev, classtype, priority (1=bad, 3=info), metadata
SID should be 1 million or higher
SNORT Demo:
cd /etc/snort
ls -l rules/
cat rules/icmp.rules
snort --version +
sudo snort -D -l /var/log/snort/ -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
ps -elf | grep snort
sudo cat /var/log/snort/alert
sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/snort.log.<log number>
sudo tcpdump -vvXntr /var/log/snort/snort.log.<log number>
sudo tcpdump -tnr /var/log/snort/snort.log.1540828602 | awk '{print $2} {print $4}' | sort | sed 's/:$//' | uniq -c
        lists all IPs in captured traffic
sudo snort -r snort.log.<log number>
ps -elf | grep snort*
kill -9 <PID>
sudo vim rules/icmp.rules
snort -D -l /var/log/snort/ -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
sudo snort -c snort.conf                run snort in terminal
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Failed IDS/IPS:
If it fails open, all traffic would get through, regardless of threat
If it fails closed, the network will be isolated from outside networks

sudo snort -r /home/activity_resources/pcaps/ids.pcap -c snort.rule
